MayaVisualizerTools
===================

Python modules, Mel scripts, and related data to help make Caustic Visualizer for Maya even better.

Caustic Visualizer is a interactive raytraced 3D rendering tool from Imagination Technologies that extends Autodesk® Maya® and Autodesk® 3Ds Max®. You can find out more about it and even get a trial edition at http://www.caustic.com

The scripts here are public, open, and NOT part of the standard Visualizer release -- they're provided to help users be even more awesome.

Installation
------------

You can download & install these tools with or without a (free) GitHub account -- though
with an account is easier!

1. Clone the repo or download and unpack the ZIP file to your desired location
1. Open the Maya file `open_me_to_install.ma` & then restart Maya -- Maya will do the rest for you

Of course, if you like the Old School Ways, just copy the .mel and .py files to your existing Maya script locations. If you use the New Way, then anytime you pull updates into the same directory, they'll be available instantly in Maya, no further installation required.

Enjoy, and please feel free to comment, share, and especially contribute here on GitHub.
