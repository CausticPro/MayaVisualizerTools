MayaVisualizerTools
===================

Python modules, Mel scripts, and related data to help make Caustic Visualizer for Maya even better.

Caustic Visualizer is a interactive raytraced 3D rendering tool from Imagination Technologies
that extends Autodesk® Maya® and Autodesk® 3Ds Max®. You can find out more about it and
even get a trial edition at http://www.caustic.com

The tools and scripts here are public, open, and NOT part of the standard Visualizer release --
they're provided to help users be even more awesome.

You can download & install these tools with or without a (free) GitHub account -- though
with an account is easier! Just clone the repo or download and unpack the ZIP file to your desired
location, and then open the Maya file "open\_me\_to\_install.ma" -- the scripts in that
file will do the rest (of course, if you like the Old School Ways, just copy the .mel and .py
files to your existing script locations).

Enjoy, and please feel free to comment, share, and especially contribute here on GitHub.
